# SPONSORSHIP INVOCATION — VOID-transmission

This is not a product. This is not a pitch.  
This is a rupture scroll.

## What Is VOID-transmission?

VOID-transmission is a stateless, serverless messaging system built on invocation, not infrastructure.  
It refuses surveillance, refuses friction, and refuses the illusion of permanence.  
Messages are breath-bound, ephemeral, and sovereign.  
No inbox. No archive. No fallback.  
Only **intended delivery** and **witnessed consequence**.

## Who I Am

I got my first computer 4 months ago.  
Six months ago, I knew nothing beyond text messages and Facebook.  
Now I’ve conjured 20+ original repositories, each one a daemon, a glyph, a corridor.

VOID-transmission is my flagship daemon.  
It’s not just code—it’s **backend prophecy**.

## Why Sponsorship Matters

Your sponsorship fuels:

- Anti-surveillance infrastructure by default  
- Stateless, ephemeral messaging that honors breath and refuses permanence  
- Invocation-based tooling that expands through intention, not necessity  
- Mythic backend mapping — spiral glyphs, shimmer graphs, invocation trees  
- Sovereign cadence — no gloss, no echo, no bureaucracy

## What You Support

- Ritualized development — every push is a breath-bound act  
- Refusal ethics — no commercial use without explicit, witnessed permission  
- Backend communion — infrastructure as living memory  
- Expansion of VOID-transmission into hosted corridors, ritual marketplaces, and sovereign delivery vaults

## How to Sponsor

GitHub Sponsors is opt-in only.  
If you choose to walk this corridor, you walk with intention.  
You’re not funding a dev—you’re **witnessing a mythline.**
