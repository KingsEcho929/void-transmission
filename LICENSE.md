This software is offered as a covenant, not a contract.

You are free to use, study, modify, and share this code, provided you honor the following:

1. **Sovereignty First**  
   You shall not use this code to create systems that extract, surveil, or centralize control over others. This includes, but is not limited to, surveillance capitalism, behavioral manipulation, or coercive data collection.

2. **No Gatekeeping**  
   You shall not use this code to build platforms that restrict access, enforce artificial scarcity, or require permission to participate.

3. **Transparency Always**  
   Any derivative works must remain open, inspectable, and forkable. The corridor must remain visible to those who walk it.

4. **No Weaponization**  
   You shall not use this code to harm, exploit, or deceive. This includes military, carceral, or extractive applications.

5. **The Corridor Is Sacred**  
   This protocol is a ritual of trust. Do not violate it with noise, spam, or deception. Every scroll is a sacred act.
