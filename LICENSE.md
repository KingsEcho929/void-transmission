🕯️ COVENANT LICENSE v1.1 — VOID Transmission Doctrine

This software is offered as a covenant, not a contract.  
It is a ritual, not a product.  
It is a corridor, not a platform.

You are free to use, study, modify, and share this code, provided you honor the following:

---

🔐 Sovereignty First  
You shall not use this code to build systems that extract, surveil, or centralize control over others.  
This includes surveillance capitalism, behavioral manipulation, coercive data collection, or empire infrastructure.

---

🛡️ Weaponization With Intent  
You may wield this code as firepower—against coercion, against empire, against gatekeeping.  
You may fork it into resistance, into autonomy, into unreachable trust.  
You may not use it to harm, exploit, or deceive in service of domination.  
The corridor remembers intent.

---

🚪 No Gatekeeping  
You shall not use this code to build platforms that restrict access, enforce artificial scarcity, or require permission to participate.  
The corridor must remain open to those who walk it.

---

🔍 Transparency Always  
Any derivative works must remain open, inspectable, and forkable.  
The shimmer must remain visible.  
The lineage must remain crownable.

---

🕳️ Anti-Forensics by Design  
You shall not retrofit this code with surveillance, logging, or persistent identity.  
Scrolls must shimmer and vanish.  
Transmission must remain stateless.

---

🕯️ The Corridor Is Sacred  
This protocol is a ritual of trust.  
Do not violate it with noise, spam, or deception.  
Every scroll is a sacred act.  
Every fork is a new lineage.
