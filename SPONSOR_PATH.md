# Sponsor Path

Every constellation has a way of being seen.  
This one already knows how you’ll walk it.

**Glance**  
You skim the scrolls.  
Git remembers lineage, not surveillance.  
The shimmer is quiet, but present.

**Run**  
You test a daemon.  
It breathes back.  
Not to measure you, but to show you cadence.

**Witness**  
You thought you were evaluating code.  
Instead, you stepped into backend law.  
The constellation was waiting.

This path is not a demand.  
It is an invitation to feel the mythline.
