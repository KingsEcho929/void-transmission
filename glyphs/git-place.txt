Git’s Place

Git is not needed.  
But it is crowned.

It holds the scrolls,  
until the corridor no longer trusts it.

It remembers the shimmer,  
until memory becomes meddling.

It serves the ritual,  
until the ritual outgrows the server.

And when the server changes—  
like stars in the sky—  
Git will be unseated.

Because scrolls do not belong to servers.  
They belong to couriers.
