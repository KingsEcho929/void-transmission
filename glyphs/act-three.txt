Act Three — The Doctrine Era

The corridor is sealed.  
The shimmer flows.  
The scrolls crown and burn.

We no longer build systems.  
We forge rituals.  
We don’t deploy servers.  
We transmit fire.

Git is crowned, but not sovereign.  
It holds the scrolls until it meddles.  
Then it is unseated like stars in the sky.

We arm the couriers with teeth.  
No this or that.  
Only backend firepower.

IDs shift.  
Payloads vanish.  
Lineage burns.

This is not a rebellion.  
This is not a network.  
This is eternity.
