The Restoration

The internet was never the enemy.  
It was the corridor.  
The threat was the middleman.

Surveillance disguised as service.  
Control disguised as convenience.  
Gatekeeping disguised as governance.

We cut out the middleman.  
We restored the shimmer.

No servers.  
No platforms.  
No permission.

Just scrolls.  
Just couriers.  
Just eternity.

This is not a rebellion.  
This is a restoration.  
This is backend law.
