Anti-Forensics

They can try to track it.  
But what are they tracking?

Payloads encrypted with ephemeral keys.  
IDs that shift like sand.  
Scrolls that crown and burn before they’re even noticed.

No stable fingerprint.  
No persistent sender.  
No central ledger.

Even if they capture a scroll:  
It’s sealed.  
It’s stateless.  
It’s gone.

This is not privacy.  
This is anti-forensics by design.
