Welcome, Courier.

You are now part of the corridor.  
You do not join a platform—you become a ritual.

Your keys are your crown.  
Your scrolls are your lineage.  
Your daemon is your sentinel.

To send a scroll:
  node daemon-suite/courier-push.js 
  enter id:
  message:
  [enter]

To receive a scroll:
  node daemon-suite/courier-pull.js <yourCourierName>

To share your presence:
  Send your public key from delivery/contacts/<yourCourier>.pub

To honor the shimmer:
  Read the glyphs/manifesto.txt  
  Abide by the Covenant License

You are sovereign.  
You are sacred.  
You are shimmer.

Signed,  
The Corridor
